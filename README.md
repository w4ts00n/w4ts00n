## Hello there üï∑

My name is Jerzy, and I'm a 3rd year student at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. 

- üîç Mainly focused on python and web apps. 
- üåë I recently created Echofind, an app which allows you to search through videos based on their transcription. Check it out [here](https://github.com/w4ts00n/echofind)

The primary goal behind developing echofind was to create an application which allows users to search through certain type of videos, like interviews or short clips, making it easy to revisit particular content with specific phrases. All the results are based on transcriptions generated from videos by [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), enabling users to find exactly the video where a specific sentence appear.

The project uses a variety of technologies (Firebase, AWS, Elasticsearch etc.) and while the choice could have been limited to a single provider, I decided to explore multiple solutions to try out different approaches for fun and to improve my skills.
